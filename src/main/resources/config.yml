#First of all, I would like to thank you for downloading my plugin :3 ( Sorry 4 my bad English )
#Please rate 5 if you found this plugin is useful for you or your server!
#So, now I'll tell you how to create your custom title on a region.
#First you'll need to copy and paste this 'rpg' section. Make sure you're not using tab. Use space only to arrange them at the correct pos
#and rename it into any region name that you've created for example, you just created an region called "Village". So you'll need to change the "rpg" section
#name into "Village". Also don't forget to use /rg flag Village title-on-exit allow. To make the title work!
#and make sure you don't delete anything inside the 'rpg' section, after that. reload the plugin and enjoy :)
